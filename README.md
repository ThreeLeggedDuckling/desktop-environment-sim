# Desktop Environment Sim

A learning tool built with **Phaser**.

This program is designed for organizations working to reduce the digital divide.


## üß∏ A Safe Environment For Learners

The main feature of this program is the **sandbox**. It provides a simplified simulation of a Windows desktop environment where learners can explore and practice mouse interactions without the fear of breaking anything.

### Features

- **Interactives icons :** Icons can be selected, double-clicking opens an empty window
- **Movable icons :** Icons can be freely moved around, allowing users to drag and drop files into folders or the recycle bin
- **Contextual menus :** Right-click anywhere to open relevant contextual menu
- **Display file extensions :** Control the visibility of file extensions


## üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Input Exercices

This feature includes a series of small exercises to help learners practice mouse inputs.

- **Double Click :** The user must double-click on an image within 500 ms. A visual cue can be activated to help with timing.
- **Drag and Drop :** The user needs to move an image into a designated zone. Upon success, a new smaller zone will appear in a different location.

### Enhanced Desktop

- **More Working Contextual Menu Options**

    Currently, only a few contextual menu options are functional. While some options will remain decorative, most basic options will be implemented soon.

- **Manual Window Resizing**

    At the moment, windows can only be resized using the maximize/restore button. Manual resizing will be added soon.

- **Taskbar Integration**

    When a window is opened, its application icon will be added to the taskbar (if not already present). A visual cue will indicate open windows, and hovering over the taskbar icon will display the windows that are currently open.

- **Window Content**

    While the focus of this program is on the desktop environment rather than perfect application simulations, windows will at least contain a brief explanation of their purpose (e.g., for a .doc file, the window might say "This is a program where you can type and arrange text").
    
    I'm working on simplified versions of some applications, like a file explorer, image viewer, and PDF reader.
